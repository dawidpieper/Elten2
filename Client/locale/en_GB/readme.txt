You should consider filling in your profile in the submenu my account.
Also, you can write down something about yourself in your visitingcard.
The second menu is called Media. You can find materials shared by other people here, as well as browse YouTube.
Files is a simple file manager. You can edit text files here, play music and, if you want, upload your avatar. An avatar is a sound recording available for playing by other users in your profile menu. Also, you can upload some files to the server, so they'll be available for download by other Elten users.
The Programs menu contains outside applications written in the Elten API.
Tools is a submenu containing, as its name says, tools developed in order to manage Elten. You can test your Internet connection or access the console here, as well as generate a new sound theme or update Elten to the newest version.
